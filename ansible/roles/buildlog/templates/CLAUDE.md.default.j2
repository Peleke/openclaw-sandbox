# OpenClaw Sandbox

This is a sandboxed VM environment for running AI agents with security isolation.

## Environment

- **VM**: Ubuntu 24.04 via Lima
- **User**: {{ ansible_user }}
- **Workspace**: {{ workspace_path }} (OverlayFS merged view)
- **OpenClaw (read-only)**: /mnt/openclaw
- **Obsidian Vault**: /mnt/obsidian (if mounted)

## Security

- Network traffic is restricted via UFW firewall
- Secrets are stored in `/etc/openclaw/secrets.env` (mode 0600)
- The VM is isolated from the host system
- Host mounts are READ-ONLY; writes go to OverlayFS upper layer
- Use `sync-gate.sh` on the host to push approved changes back

## Getting Started

```bash
# Check gateway status
systemctl status openclaw-gateway

# View logs
journalctl -u openclaw-gateway -f

# Run OpenClaw commands
cd {{ workspace_path }} && bun run ...
```
